          <p>Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, mother of Telemachus Orfanos. She woke up from a phone call being informed of her son being killed in the Thousand Oaks Massacre."My son was in Las Vegas with a lot of his friends and he came home. He didn't come home last night," his mother told ABC News.  Imagine having a son, brother, cousin, close friend, coming home surviving the bloodiest mass shooting in US history. That right there is already hearting breaking news knowing that your  son, brother, cousin, close friend, was near to death. One man was responsible for this carnage. It only took one man and his guns. Fortunately ,  Telemachus survive this mass shooting. Yet, lightning hit twice for this young man.

          <p>A 6 year old came to school with a gun. Then put a bullet into the innocent girl of Kayla Rolland. Then the NRA had the auducity to come to Michigan the next day to have a campaign rally supporting guns. Is this justice? It just proves the arrogence of the support of the NRA and people who support the 2nd amendment.</p>

          <p>Mothers are now worried top take their kids to school because of the frequent mass shootings. This mother sent her 6 year old son to get an education. She sent her son to school and he didn't return. This mother will never be able to see the soul and cheer in this young boy's eyes. They'll never open again. This isn't the 1st time a mother lost a child, and it won't be the last one if we don't do anything to stop it.</p>
